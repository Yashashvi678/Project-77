               2. Debugger - Visual Studio includes a debugger that works both as a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger.<br>
               3. Designer - Visual Studio includes a host of visual designers to aid in the development of applications.<br>
               4. Extensibility - Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to extend its capabilities. These extensions "plug into" Visual Studio and extend its functionality.
